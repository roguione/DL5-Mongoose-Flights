## Intro
Today in the Intro to Mongoose lesson you Created and Read documents using a Movie Model.

In this lab, you'll do the same, except you'll create and use a Flight model.

You'll begin by creating a mongoose-flights project in this repository.

1. Create a new express application `express -ef .`
2. Refactor the express starter code 'users' module names to match the 'flights' resource.
3. Add a .env to your application and add the file type `.env` to the `.gitignore`
4. Install your base dependencies and test your code. 

FYI, future lessons will expand upon the mongoose-movies project, and the labs will expand upon the mongoose-flights project!

The final version of mongoose-flights (parts 1 thru 3 combined) will be a deliverable, so do each part and don't fall behind.
